    <h3>Hello! Welcome to my site, where you can learn more about me and see what I did. You can learn something you haven't known before, or be entertained by my personality!</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>I am Farhan Chowdury. My parents are from Bangladesh, but I was born and raised here in Brooklyn, New York. I am a junior at Bedford Academy High Shcool and the Brooklyn STEAM Center.</p>
    <p>I am currently learning Fullstack development, which I have used such knowledge to create this site.</p>
    <p>I enjoy photography, video gaming, and travelling for fun!</p>
