        <p>Born in Brooklyn, New York, to parents from Bangladesh, I have been fiddling with computers since a young
            age. Currently a junior scholar at Bedford Academy High School and the Brooklyn STEAM Center, I am learning
            Fullstack Development.</p>
        <p>I can speak fluent English, decent Bengali (oral only), some German, and a little bit of Spanish too.</p>

        <h3>My origins</h3>
        <p>I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, in the United States. Both of my parents were born and raised in
            Bangladesh, though. I grew up along with a younger sister. We have traveled and explored a lot, and me
            personally, learned and taken on a lot that can be used in the future.</p>
