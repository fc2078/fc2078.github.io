        <h3>Interest in Technology</h3>
        <p>
            I like to use devices everyday, from iPhones, to iPads, to a MacBook, to my Windows PC. I know a lot about
            computer hardware as well! I am coding everyday and managing my devices on a regular basis.
        </p>
        <p>I also built a PC from scratch once. Check out my projects for more info!</p>

        <p>Photography was a hobby I picked up about two years ago. Sometimes I like taking pictures with my camera.</p>
        <p>I also like to travel. I love going places to explore and hang out in.</p>
